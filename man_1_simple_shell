.SH NAME
hsh \- a simple UNIX command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a command line interpreter that reads user input from the standard input and executes commands based on the environment and PATH. It is designed to mimic the basic behavior of /bin/sh.
.SH FEATURES
- Displays a prompt ($ ) in interactive mode.
- Searches for commands in the PATH environment variable.
- Handles command line arguments.
- Includes built-in commands: \fBenv\fR and \fBexit\fR.
.SH USAGE
To start the shell, run the executable:
.IP
\fB./hsh\fR
.PP
The shell can be used in interactive mode by typing commands at the prompt, or in non-interactive mode by piping commands:
.IP
\fBecho "ls -l" | ./hsh\fR
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
The shell executes commands by searching for the executable file in the directories specified in the \fBPATH\fR environment variable. If the command contains a slash (/), it is treated as a direct path and executed immediately if found.
.SH BUILT-INS
.TP
\fBexit\fR
Exits the shell with the status of the last command executed.
.TP
\fBenv\fR
Prints the current environment variables.
.SH BUGS
