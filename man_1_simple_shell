.SH NAME
hsh \- a simple UNIX command line interpreter (Shell)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a command line interpreter that provides a traditional UNIX user interface. It reads commands from standard input (either from a terminal or a pipe) and executes them. It follows the logic of the Bourne Shell (\fB/bin/sh\fR) by searching the \fBPATH\fR for executables and managing child processes.

.SH PROJECT FILES
The shell is built from several modular files, each handling a specific responsibility:
.TP
.B main.c
The entry point. It manages the infinite loop, prints the prompt \fB($)\fR, and coordinates input reading.
.TP
.B shell.c
Core process engine. Contains the logic for \fBforking\fR and \fBwaiting\fR for child processes.
.TP
.B path.c
The location engine. It manually parses the \fBPATH\fR environment variable to find the absolute path of a command.
.TP
.B exec.c
Execution wrapper. Links the path resolution and the process management together.
.TP
.B env.c / builtin_env.c
Environment management. Handles internal access to environment variables without using \fBgetenv\fR.
.TP
.B trim.c
Input sanitizer. Removes leading and trailing whitespace to ensure commands are parsed correctly.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
To execute a command, the shell follows these steps:
.IP 1. 
The input is read and split into tokens (command and arguments).
.IP 2. 
If the command contains a slash (\fB/\fR), it attempts to execute that specific path.
.IP 3. 
If no slash is found, it searches every directory listed in the \fBPATH\fR environment variable.
.IP 4. 
Once found, a child process is created via \fBfork(2)\fR.
.IP 5. 
The child process replaces itself with the command using \fBexecve(2)\fR.
.IP 6. 
The parent process waits for the child to finish and captures the exit status.

.SH BUILT-INS
.TP
\fBexit\fR
Terminates the shell. If the shell was running a script or piped input, it returns the exit status of the last executed command.
.TP
\fBenv\fR
Prints the current environment variables to standard output, one per line.

.SH RETURN VALUE
When exiting, \fBhsh\fR returns the exit status of the last command executed. If the end-of-file (EOF) is reached (via \fBCtrl+D\fR), the shell exits with status 0.

.SH ERROR HANDLING
If a command is not found, \fBhsh\fR prints an error message to \fBstderr\fR in the following format:
.PP
.RS
\fBprog_name: line_number: command: not found\fR
.RE

.SH BUGS
Does not currently support shell variables, aliases, or advanced features like globbing (*, ?).
